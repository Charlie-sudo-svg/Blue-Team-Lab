# Windows 10 Endpoint Setup

### Quick Note
The photo of the network setup shown in ````/Documentation/Network-Setup.md```` shows a png of the network setup made in Cisco Packet Tracer. In the photo we see 2 seperate Windows 10 pro endpoints.
For the setup of this project, they are practically both setup the same way. Some configurations here are also mentioned in other config files like ````Sysmonconfig.md```` and ````Windows_Server_config.md````,
To keep it simple and to avoid redundancies I'll only include setups that are *not* included in those files.
