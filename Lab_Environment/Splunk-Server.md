# Splunk Server Setup

### Installation
To install Splunk Enterprise I used Ubuntu Server 24.04.1 -> https://ubuntu.com/download/server. With the server loaded onto a virtual machine the next step is to actually install Splunk Enterprise onto the server itself which is done easily with shared files.
