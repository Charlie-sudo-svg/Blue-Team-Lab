# Project Overview 

This is a hands-on blue team exercise that is supposed to simulate real world enterprise security environment. It focuses on Windows system hardening, attack simulation, and security monitoring using industry-standard tools. The goal is to build a secure Active Directory (AD) environment, launch ethical cyber attacks, detect malicious activity using SIEM tools, and develop incident response procedures.
