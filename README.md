## Project Goals 

- Build hands-on cybersecurity experience 🏆
- Master Windows security & Active Directory 🔐
- Learn SIEM & threat detection 📊
- Document and showcase for job applications 💼

By the end of this project, I will hope to have a fully operational security lab with attack simulations, detection, and response capabilities.
